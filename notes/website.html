		  <p1>      Designing a new portfolio is easy. Committing your<br>

           <p2>     I first started working on a new draft of my portfolio in 2011. I haven't been<br>
                    working on this update for two years, but I have been coming back to it ever few<br>
                    months. It's undergone countless iterations.<br> <br> <br>
          </p2>

          <p3>      Why has it taken so long? I've been afraid to commit to any one idea. It seemed like<br>
                    when I would decide upon a certain direction, the web would up and change its<br>
                    game (think responsive design). This was more down to me taking my sweet time<br>
                    more than anything else.<br> <br> <br>
          </p3>

          <p4>      Not that I'm complaining. It practically became a hobby of mine to tinker with a<br>
                    new portfolio. In a way I'm a little sad that the sketching / prototyping / designing / <br>
                    coding elements of the portfolio are ultimately finished, but I'm excited to add some <br>
                    flourishes in the coming weeks and months (I've been toying with snap svg which <br>
                    I'm looking forward to integrating).<br> <br> <br>
         </p4>

         <p5>       In the next few weeks I'm also going to write about the decisions I made while<br>
                    building out this site - inspiration, evolution, content management, execution. <br>
                    Hopefully it may be of some use to those starting out with building their first <br>
                    portfolio - maybe help shave a year or two off it here and there!<br>
